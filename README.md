# Wikipedia Rebuild

#### By Brian Scherner

#### A website built to visually resemble the Wikipedia homepage.

## Description

This website visually resembles the Wikipedia homepage. It is designed to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It demonstrates my understanding of elements such as divs, classes, floats, spans, id's, containers, jumbotrons etc. Users can view the same information they would see on the Wikipedia homepage, styled in the same format.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the middle level of the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

* The links at the top of the page (Main page, talk, read, etc...) are not spaced in the same format as the Wikipedia homepage. I plan to change this once I gain more knowledge of flexbox properties.
* While this website looks roughly the same as the Wikipedia homepage, it does not function like it. I plan to fix this once I gain knowledge of Javascript.
* Once I familiarize myself more with Javascript, I plan to add features such as navbars, search bars, and other functional features.
