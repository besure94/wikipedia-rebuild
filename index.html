				<p>The <a href="#">Providence and Worcester Railroad</a> (P&W) is an <a href="#">American Class II railroad</a> operating 612 miles (985 km) of tracks in <a href="#">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="#">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="#">Connecticut</a>, and <a href="#">New York</a>. It was formed in 1844 to connect its <a href="#">eponymous</a> cities, and ran its first trains in 1847. P&W later built <a href="#">a branch</a> to <a href="#">East Providence</a>, <a href="#">Rhode Island</a>, and <a href="#">double-tracked</a> its main line after a fatal train collision. P&W remained independent until 1888, when the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad leased it; the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (the New Haven) assumed the lease in 1892. P&W remained leased until the New Haven was merged into Penn Central (PC) in 1968. When PC threatened to abandon the line, P&W's shareholders convinced regulators to give them back their railroad, and P&W returned to independence in 1973 after 85 years. P&W grew from under 100 miles (161 km) by purchasing other lines, expanding more than sixfold. In 2016, P&W was purchased by railroad holding company Genesee & Wyoming.</p>
