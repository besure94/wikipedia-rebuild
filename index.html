					<p>The <a href="#">Providence and Worcester Railroad</a> (P&W) is an <a href="#">American Class II railroad</a> operating 612 miles (985 km) of tracks in <a href="#">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="#">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="#">Connecticut</a>, and <a href="#">New York</a>. It was formed in 1844 to connect its <a href="#">eponymous</a> cities, and ran its first trains in 1847. P&W later built <a href="#">a branch</a> to <a href="#">East Providence</a>, <a href="#">Rhode Island</a>, and <a href="#">double-tracked</a> its main line after <a href="#">a fatal train collision</a>. P&W remained independent until 1888, when the <a href="#">New York, Providence and Boston Railroad</a> leased it; the <a href="#">New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad</a> (the New Haven) assumed the lease in 1892. P&W remained leased until the New Haven was merged into <a href="#">Penn Central</a> (PC) in 1968. When PC threatened to abandon the line, P&W's shareholders convinced regulators to give them back their railroad, and P&W returned to independence in 1973 after 85 years. P&W grew from under 100 miles (161 km) by purchasing other lines, expanding more than sixfold. In 2016, P&W was purchased by railroad holding company <a href="#">Genesee & Wyoming</a>.</p>
